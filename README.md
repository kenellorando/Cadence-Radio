## About
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). Originally started in February 2017, the project is my first endeavour to practice a full range of IT-skills including front-end design, web programming, databases, and Linux server management. Development continues today with a focus on back-end technology.

The server typically plays all the genres of music I like, mostly a mix of classic rock, synthpop, and metal. I occasionally override the server and play a certain genre, artist, or the same song on an endless loop.
