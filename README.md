## About
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). Originally started in February 2017, the project is my first endeavour to practice a full range of IT-skills including front-end design, web programming, databases, and Linux server management. Development continues today with a focus on back-end technology.

The server typically plays all the genres of music I like, mostly a mix of classic rock, synthpop, and metal. I occasionally override the server and play a certain genre, artist, or the same song on an endless loop.

## Contributing
To contribute to Cadence Radio, first install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), as our Space Station theme uses files hosted on LFS.

As `git clone` only permits serial file download, LFS suggests disabling LFS for the clone operation and then pulling the files separately, as this can be done in parallel. The commands suggested are (taken from the [LFS Tutorial](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial)):

    GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/username/my_lfs_repo.git destination_dir
    #git lfs ls-files # optionally see all the - showing the lfs files are not checked out
    git lfs pull
    #git lfs ls-files # optionally see all the * showing the lfs files are checked out
